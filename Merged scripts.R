# Why do we do this?
{
# Well, to measure the effect of the longevity bonds, we need to first 
# get measures that longevity influences.

# In our case, longevity causes our fund to pay more benefits than expected, so
# we expect to see a faster depletion and thus a higher risk of the fund not 
# being able to cover member's benefits
# That is exactly what the VAR @ 95% level and the Probability of Ruin measures,
# but to measure that, we can either do it theoretically or empirically.

# We can't possibly include all the complexities in a theoretical approach, hence
# we have to follow an empirical approach. And that's why we need everything on
# one script.

# I don't have the computing power right now to be able to run the full script,
# so for debugging purposes, I'm only going to consider a fund with 10 members

# Also, we can't just copy and paste everything and expect it to work.
# I mean, it can work theoretically, but the models will need to be linked to
# each other. This means no creating or importing csv files

# Luckily for me, my style of coding has set the places where the links should 
# happen close to the start or end of the script, with very few exceptions here
# and there.
}

# Let's go!

# First, let's set a script wide seed for consistent results. As it is now, 
# the seeds are giving us only one possible result for each piece of the model.

set.seed(780)

#Second, we need our mortality table and Lee - Carter Model

{
  
  # So, this R script will be used to create the lee carter model,
  # or rather fit the parameters of the Lee Carter model, based on the 
  # mortality data gathered from the CMI.
  
  # Then, it will create our custom mortality base, where we can control the 
  # the rate at which mortality decreases.
  
  #There will essentially be 2 models, one for male mortality, the other for female.
  
  #I first start off by gathering and organising the data received from the CMI team.

  # With this, I can start constructing the Lee carter model 
  
  #First I explain the Lee Carter model basics and some assumptions
  {
  # So basically, the Lee Carter model is ln(m_x,t) = a_x + b_x * k_t
  # a_x is the average mortality for age x
  # b_x is the sensitivity to changes of mortality of age_x to k_x
  # k_t is the time-varying mortality index
  
  # So this approach assumes that mortality decreases at a random but steady rate,
  # this is just one of the drawbacks of the Lee-Carter model.
  
  # Intuitively, mortality should be decreasing at a decreasing rate, since
  # humans can only live that long. Medical advances and higher quality of life
  # only reduces the amount of causes of death, but it doesn't make us immortal,
  # hence we can expect there to be an upper limit to which current drivers of
  # mortality improvements can improve mortality, and the closer we get to
  # that limit, the more difficult it is to improve mortality an additional, 
  # say 1%. However, determining at which rate the rate at which mortality 
  # decreases itself decreases, is something at least beyond the time constraint
  # we have for this research project.
  
  
  # But determining those parameters is too much trouble to do manually
  # Great thing about R, is that there is already a package that can aid us 
  # with this forecast.
  
  # The package is called demography, and it uses the lca()
  # function to implement the Lee-Carter model.
  
  #Though there isn't a direct parameter in this function to control the
  # improvements in mortality, this can be done indirectly by
  # manually overwriting the k_t estimates of the fit before forecasting
  # which is as easy as replacing one column with your own custom column of
  # the same dimensions.

    # ages, which is what is expected.
    # Though, I can't just set the parameters and make it work.
    # Thus I will be doing something that is similar to a lag later on.
    # Meaning that my ages will be skewed so low, that the simulation
    # will run a couple of years, and as members die off, the distribution of ages 
    # will be automatically set.
    
    #For example, I'll generate a skewed sample of ages between 20-90,
    # with a higher probability of sampling ages between 20-30 than ages 70-90
    # then, I will first simulate 40 years, and then whoever is still alive 
    # after 40 years, will remain in the scheme for our choice of members
    # on which we will simulate the annuities.

      # initial age distribution, thus I'll have to look up what is the average

      # 30 years younger.

   # Now normally the consequence of longevity can be worsened by those
   # with higher benefit levels living longer than those with lower
   # benefit levels
   
   # But this variation is more due to sampling risk rather than longevity risk,
   # and quite honestly opens up a whole new can of worms regarding the actual
   # mortality rates that we should use.
   # But our mortality rates are artificial anyways. They are based on the real thing
   # but in the end it is us who decide how bad the longevity ends up being.
   
   # Thus to remove sampling and some parameter risk, the assumption will be that
   # everyone in our member base just happen to receive the same benefit level.
   
   #We can include an upgrade to assign varying levels of benefits later, but for this
   # script, it is more important to get something to build on in the first place.
   
   # We also assume that the benefits increase at a fixed rate to provide some protection
   # against inflation, since making them inflation-linked will bring in inflation risk
   # , tracking risk, parameter risk, model risk and random fluctuation risk, all of which 
   # can obscure the longevity risk that we are trying to target here, hence the assumption.
